Simple forum for fun. 

### The forum is going down, this was very stupid

I learnt a few things from writing this simple forum - how to buy a domain name, setup dynamic dns and redirects, as well as input sanitization. I also learnt that no matter how I phrased it, this was going to turn into a salt chamber, and that as fun and funny a idea it seemed when we first came up with the idea, its stupid, and creating our own salt chamber in response to a salt mine is pointless. 

### Never again
